[Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp) for more on push & pop

```
//PUSH (onto the end)
array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
array1.push(10)

console.log(array1) //[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

//POP (off of the end)
array2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
array2.pop

console.log(array2) //[1,2,3,4]

```

**Today, you learned how to:**

- [x] Add an element to the end of an array (using .push)
- [x] Remove and element from the end of an array (using .pop)
- [x] Remember, both adding & removing elements, changes the original array.
      So the original array you were working with is now peramaently different.
      This is called mutation.
